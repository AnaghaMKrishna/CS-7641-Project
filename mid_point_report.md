## Literature Review  

Accurate classification of cancer types based on RNA-sequencing data is a crucial task in computational oncology, with significant implications for diagnosis. Our goal is to use ML to predict the type of cancer based on RNA-sequencing data. This classification is essential in the clinic to support and validate histology and will help guide the treatment of patients.

 Previous studies have laid a strong groundwork for us to expand upon. Jaskowiak et al. compared 4 clustering methods and 12 distance measures and concluded that k-medoids and hierarchical clustering with average linkage were superior over complete or single linkage[1]. Moreover, Freyhult et al. pinpointed that the preprocessing steps in using RNAseq data can majorly influence performance[2]. Since we are working with high dimensional data, we aim to test multiple feature reduction techniques like those employed by David Kallbergâ€™s group analyzing 11 such techniques[3].

### Dataset Description

Our dataset contains 6 files containing gene expression profiles of 6 cancer types, present in sample x genes format with 2,952 patient samples and 20,531 genes. The values represent the counts of gene products in the sample.

## Problem Definition

### Problem
Diagnosing cancer and correct subtype classification from samples collected from patients is crucial in effectively treating cancer. To aid this time-sensitive task, we propose to apply ML techniques for accurately categorizing cancer types by analyzing expression levels of cancer type-specific *signature* genes as a supplementary tool for the clinicians to accelerate diagnosis procedure.


### Motivation
Humans have ~20,000 protein-coding genes. Using manual techniques to identify differentially expressed(DE) genes among conditions is impractical, necessitating the use of sophisticated models to churn this very-high dimensional data. Moreover, DE gene identification is an important step in bioinformatics pipelines for downstream analyses.

### Data Preprocessing Methods Implemented

#### a. Merging Datasets Based on Common Genes
We wanted to ensure that all the datasets we used had expression values present for a common set of genes. This would allow our model to get trained on features that are present across the dataset and are not missing. Thus, we decided to find the common genes shared between all the datasets and merged all 6 gene expression files (each corresponding to a type of cancer) into one dataset for downstream model training. The resulting file contained labels corresponding to each of the cancer types, and their expression value for each subject. In total we had 11,313 genes shared between 2,952 samples that we used for our analysis.

#### b. SMOTE to deal with class imbalance
As there was an imbalance in the number of observations between classes, we decided to use the SMOTE algorithm (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) which synthetically created data points for under-represented classes. This was done to avoid the model being biased towards over-represented data. Upon using SMOTE, we balanced the classes such that each class now had 606 data points.
The Barplot below shows the number of samples in each class type before and after using SMOTE.
