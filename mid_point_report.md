## Literature Review  

Accurate classification of cancer types based on RNA-sequencing data is a crucial task in computational oncology, with significant implications for diagnosis. Our goal is to use ML to predict the type of cancer based on RNA-sequencing data. This classification is essential in the clinic to support and validate histology and will help guide the treatment of patients.

 Previous studies have laid a strong groundwork for us to expand upon. Jaskowiak et al. compared 4 clustering methods and 12 distance measures and concluded that k-medoids and hierarchical clustering with average linkage were superior over complete or single linkage[1]. Moreover, Freyhult et al. pinpointed that the preprocessing steps in using RNAseq data can majorly influence performance[2]. Since we are working with high dimensional data, we aim to test multiple feature reduction techniques like those employed by David Kallberg’s group analyzing 11 such techniques[3].
